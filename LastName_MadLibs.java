    This meant [person’s name] had 9 minutes left before he [verb].
    
    Panicking, the [animal] grabbed a [object] and ran toward the [vehicle] parked outside.
    Along the way, a [adjective] [creature] tried to stop him by yelling, “[funny phrase]!”
    But there was no time to waste.
    
    He sprinted past the [place, plural], through a crowd of [plural noun], and into the [adjective] building.
    Inside, he found a [object] glowing with a [color] light.
    Picking it up, he realized it was the key to saving [silly noun].
    
    With only seconds left, the [animal] shouted to [person’s name], “We must [verb] before it’s too late!”
    The clock struck [time], and suddenly everything turned [color].
